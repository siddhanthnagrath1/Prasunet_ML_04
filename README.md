# <center><b>Hand Signs Classification</b>
</center>

## Objective 🏠
- the goal is to design and develop a robust hand gesture recognition model capable of accurately identifying and classifying various hand gestures from both image and video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems in applications such as virtual reality, robotics, and smart environments.

## About the Dataset 📊

- Download the dataset from here: <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog'>Kaggel Dataset</a> 



- Hand gesture recognition database is presented, composed by a set of near infrared images acquired by the Leap Motion sensor.

- The database is composed by 10 different hand-gestures (showed above) that were performed by 10 different subjects (5 men and 5 women)

**<u>Optional: Creating a Virtual Environment</u>**

1. Install virtualenv (if not already installed):

   - If you haven't installed virtualenv, you can do so using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

    - In the terminal and run this command:
    ``` bash
    virtualenv venv
    ```

3.  Activate the virtual environment:

    - To activate the virtual environment:
    ``` bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

**2. Download the Repo 📥**


1. Open your Git client or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:

```bash 
git clone 
```

**3. Install required Dependencies  📦**
1. Open terminal/cmd.
2. Navigate to repo directory
3. Run the following command to install dependencies from requirements.txt:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Host the project Locally 🌐**

- After installing the required dependencies, run the following command to start the project locally:

``` bash
streamlit run server.py
```
